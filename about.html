                    <h3>Beach</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I love the beach. I like the smell of the sea and also like
                        swimming. The view is just spectacular to watch. The sound of the waves is calming to the
                        ears. Playing around is fun at the beach.</p>

                    <h3>Favorite Kpop Artist</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">BLACKPINK. They're my favorite Kpop group. I like how they're mixed
                        up from different cultures. They were the first Kpop group that I actually became a fan of.
                        Their songs are what I usually listen to on different occasions.</p>

                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm the eldest with a sister. My mom and dad are shown in the
                        picture. You can clearly see who I resemble more, and that's my mom, while my sister looks
                        like my dad. So it's a fair distribution of genes.</p>

                    <h3>Khaleesi</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Our one and only fur baby Khaleesi. She's been ours for 2 years
                        now. She's a very bratty but sweet cat. We named her after the Game of Thrones character,
                        the Queen of Dragons.</p>

                    <h3>Nature</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I love going to high places with fresh air. I love watching the
                        view down below. This is one of the things I like to do. Go around on road trips with trees
                        and the sound of peace and quiet.</p>

                    <h3>Travelling</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I like going to different places. Venturing out to a place you've
                        never been is exciting. You'll never know what you'd see and learn. Sometimes it could be
                        disappointing, it could be beyond what you expected, or maybe just neutral.</p>

                    <h3>Instrument & Music</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I started playing guitar in 4th grade. It was just me being curious
                        and I found it nice listening to the sound it makes. Music and instruments go together. I love
                        listening as well as playing, but I'm mediocre. I still love it a lot.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">These two are people I'm close to and who my parents have known
                        to like. They've been one of my closest people, who knows me quite a lot. </p>
